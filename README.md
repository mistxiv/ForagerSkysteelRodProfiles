# Forager Skysteel Rod Profiles

## Installation

Copy the contents of the `profiles` folder to `C:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\Forager\profiles` and reload LUA.

## Usage

* These profiles just do the fishing.  Doing the quests coming prepared is up to you.
* These were tested in full Landsaint's gear with plenty of Hi-Cordials and Peppered Popotoes for more GP.
* Buy plenty of bait.  You'll probably go through up to 2000 Signature Skyball.  Forager does this for you, but you should buy in bulk to save trips instead.
* Forager helpfully equips the appropriate fishing rod when it's required for a catch.  Make sure to unequip it in order to turn in quests.
* All profiles use Intuition II to maximize HQ chances.  Identical Cast is used for steps 3+
* `Skysteel FSH 1+2` will fish 40 HQ Thinker's Coral and 60 HQ Dragonspine.  Both of these steps can be done at the same time.  Ogre Horn Snail are surface slapped.
* `Skysteel FSH3` will fish 60 HQ Petal Shell
* `Skysteel FSH4` will fish 70 HQ Allagan Hunter
* `Skysteel FSH5` will fish 100 Flintstrike and 100 Pickled Pom.  Of course your inventory can't hold this many, so tick off "skip" in Forager for the one you've completed and make sure you have enough free inventory slots.  You need 200 of the end product here, and the quality stages yield 7-2-1, so 100 ought to cover pretty bad luck.  Feel free to stop early.

Congrats on your purple rod. üçÜüé£
